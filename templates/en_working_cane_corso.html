                    Originally, Cane Corsos were used in war zones where they would be used in many attack efforts. Some
                    dogs would be outfitted with buckets of flammable fluids and sent charging through enemy lines
                    carrying flames to subdue or distract the enemy just before a ground attack. Some dogs were trained
                    to attack enemies in battle, sometimes even sent wearing collars with spikes and knives around their
                    necks and ankles. When the Western Empire fell apart, the remaining dogs slipped into more
                    civilian-related job roles and were a common sight across the countrysides of Italy. These dogs were
                    used for hunting, to protect and drive livestock, to patrol farms and vineyards, and of course, to
                    serve as loyal guardians of their owners and their properties.

                    You can't fool genetics. Most of the ancient features of the breed are still visible today. Cane
                    Corso was, is and will be a working dog!

                    These days, the Cane Corso may be most known as a loyal and serving family dog with its cooly
                    competent personality and confidently willful demeanor, but this breed is still hard at work beyond
                    being just a beloved pet companion. Cane Corsos are also still highly prized for their working
                    capabilities and are used in several different fields because of their natural-born abilities.

                <h4 class="h4-titles">For security reasons, please remember!</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    When undertaking work with a dog,<strong>ALWAYS</strong> use experienced and recommended trainers
                    who know the specifics of the breed. Never do it on your own, it may do more harm than good.
