<div class="breed-history">
    <p>
        "According to the breed standard of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI - International Canine
        Federation), the Cane Corso descends from the
        molossoid dogs of Ancient Rome; it was once distributed throughout much of the Italian peninsula, but in the
        recent past was found only in Puglia, in southern Italy. After the collapse of the mezzadria system of
        share-cropping in the 1960s, the dogs became rare. The modern breed derives from selective breeding from about
        1980 of a few surviving animals. A breed society, the Società Amatori Cane Corso, was formed in
        1983. The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana (ENCI - National Entity of Italian
        Cynology) in 1994. It was provisionally accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1996, and
        received full acceptance in
        2007. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club of the United States in 2010."<sup
